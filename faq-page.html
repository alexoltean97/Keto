                    <h3>What kind of weight-loss results should I expect when following the Ketogenic diet?</h3>
                    <p>Some people can lose up to 4 pounds per week, others less. It really depends on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How well you follow the keto principles</li>
                        <li>What other weight-loss strategies you have in place (such as exercising)</li>
                        <li>Your metabolism</li>
                        <li>How long you follow the diet</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It’s <b>very difficult to estimate</b> how much weight a person can lose on any diet because our bodies behave differently. But the keto diet has the best results if you follow these recipes and advice to the letter and avoid ‘cheat days’.</p>

                    <h3>My life is so busy right now. What if I don’t have time to focus on following the keto diet now?
                    </h3>
                    <p>The recipes here are designed to keep you in the kitchen for <b>less than 15 minutes</b>. We focused on simple dishes that anyone can make and fit into their schedule.
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, the 5-Star Keto Masterclass presents a lot of tips and tricks on how to be <b>more efficient in the kitchen</b>, which can lower the cooking time even more.

                    <h3>Do I know how much carbs, protein and fats are in each dish?
                    </h3>
                    <p>All the dishes come with the exact amount of fat, carbs, and protein.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These nutrients are calculated per serving, so even if you end up using larger ingredient quantities to make more servings, if you keep the proportions, you can <b>easily figure out how much macronutrients</b> are you eating in a day.
                    </p>

                    <p>Additionally, the <b>5-Star Keto Masterclass</b> includes a chapter that will teach you how to calculate macros and calories yourself, for any dish. So, when you’re ready to go beyond the recipes in the masterclass and want to start experimenting, you can still control your macro and calorie intake.

                    <h3>What are the benefits of ketogenic diet?
                    </h3>
                    <p>Apart from weight loss, studies show that the keto diet can also:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Lower blood sugar levels</li>
                        <li>Improve concentration</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>However, it’s important to understand that the keto diet can affect people differently. <b>Everyone’s body is different</b>, so it’s possible for some of the benefits to be less obvious than others, depending on what you want to get out of the keto diet.</p>

                    <h3>Do I need to count calories?
                    </h3>
                   <p> Not necessarily. The focus in the keto diet is to make sure you are consuming enough fats (and low carbs), so that you enter ketosis. The recipes in this masterclass also come with the number of calories a dish has per serving, but that’s more so that you have a view of how much you are consuming during the day.</p>

                    <h3>Can you drink alcohol on this diet?</h3>
                    <p>Most alcoholic beverages contain <b>high levels of carbs</b>, which can prevent you from entering ketosis.</p>
                    <p>Some low-carb drinks are available, but they can still affect how fast you enter ketosis, and how long you stay on it. It’s best to avoid any type of alcohol while following this diet, at least while you’re trying to reach your ideal weight.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you do, and only need to keto diet for weight maintenance or other health effects, you can slowly add moderate alcohol intake back into your diet. Cheers!

                    <h3>Can I put my kids on this diet?</h3>
                    <p>Growing children <span>should not be put on a keto diet</span>, or any kind of diet that’s not recommended by their pediatrician. While their bodies are developing, they need a lot of nutrients, including carbs, to grow up strong and healthy. Though the keto has many health benefits, it greatly restricts carbs, and is not appropriate for children.
                    </p>
                    <p>If your child needs to lose weight, it’s best to <b>talk to a child nutritionist</b> instead, to develop a balanced diet for them. </p>

                   </p>

                    <p>The masterclass presents a detailed explanation of who should or should not follow a keto diet but if you have any doubts, check with your doctor before going on the diet. </p>

                    <h3>What’s the difference between the keto diet and other fad diets?
                    </h3>
                    <p>The keto diet was never designed as a quick fat-loss diet. It was created by scientists to <b>carefully (and safely)</b> allow the body to enter the state of ketosis. It’s health promises are backed up by countless scientific studies and trials.</p>
